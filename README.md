# Coffee Quality Python Analysis ☕️

## Objective

This project focused on identifying characteristics of higher-quality coffee. The analysis could be used by a coffee shop to aid in sourcing the best coffee possible. This could give the coffee shop an edge in a competitive market. 


## Data

We used and analyzed the following datasets:
- [Coffee Quality Data (via Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihb/coffee-quality-data-cqi)
- [Coffee Dataset (via Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michals22/coffee-dataset)

## Tools

For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
- pandas - for data analysis
- seaborn, matplotlib & pylab - for visualization
- folium - for geographical analysis
- sklearn - for linear regression modeling and k-Means clustering
- statsmodel - for stationarity testing and time series analysis (Dickey-Fuller Test)

## Storyboard

The findings of this analysis can be [found here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CoffeeQualityAnalysisProject/CoffeeQualityAnalysisPresentation?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). The storyboard doesn’t contain every step I took as part of the analysis—only those relevant to the final results.
